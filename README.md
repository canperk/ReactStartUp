# ReactStartUp

The reason of this template is just try something to see basic results. I am really bored configuring gulp, node js, webpack, require and etc...

I used :

1. WebPack for asynchronous module definitions
2. JS file concatination is made with gulp
3. React is the JS framework (MVVM is the best)
4. React Router sample (Just 2 routes existing)
5. Fixed design not handle css things
    
    -Bootstrap and I edited some silly things
    

I hope that, people who want to use this template will not waste time just to see simple things.
